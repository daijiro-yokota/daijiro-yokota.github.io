                <h2>World Input-Output Table</h2>

                <p>Updated on Mar. 5, 2020</p>

                <p>We have seen an increasing global integration through international trade and technological development across industries around the world.
                  An accurate analysis of international economy requires comprehensive datasets that capture the dynamic interrelatedness of countries and industries.
                  In 2009, the European Commission started the World Input Output Database (WIOD) project to increase our undesstanding of international trade in goods and services.</p>


                <p>The core value of this project was the creation of the international Input-Output table.
                  The table provides time-series data of the intermediate input values delivered across sectors worldwide at current prices, covering 27 EU countries and 14 major countries between 1995 and 2010.
                  For each country, it details intermediate input and final output for 35 industries including agriculture, construction and manufacturing industries, and services industries.
                  The table better captures the trade participation of each country by tracking the value-added at each stage of production, including upstream suppliers in the value chains.
                  This advantage lets us measure the formation of global value chains (GVCs) with the method created by Timmer ‘et al (2015), which transforms intermediate input values to value-added for every sector.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.wiod.org/home" target="_blank">LEARN MORE</strong></a> about the project from their website. </p>

                <p>Using this table, I have done the following two collaborative research projects at Macalester.</p>

                  <h5>Introduction</h5>

                  <p>
                  Researchers found that the recent trend toward fragmentation of suppliers across the national borders in the global economy is potentially putting the firms to the hidden risks of the various supply shock in the more expansive areas.
                  <strong>Natural disaster</strong> is one of the most discussed examples of these shocks because of its unpredictable nature and the size of impacts on the local economy in the damaged area.
                  In order to understand the hidden risk, we measured the impacts of foreign natural disasters to GVCs formed by the Japanese industries as the last stage of production.
                  Specifically, we calculated the GVC-Dependency of the 15 manufacturing industries based on value added contribution made by the 40 foreign countries in WIOT.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  We first compared the values for 1995 and 2010 to capture the trend in Japan. Then, we calculated the share of <strong>foreign value added (FVA)</strong> by each country and matched the numbers with the country’s disaster risk measured from the <strong>EM_DAT International Disaster Database</strong>.
                  Multiplying these values, we created our key variable, <strong>GVC-Risk</strong> for each Japanese manufacturing industry.
                  In order to measure the economic impact of the  natural  disasters,  we  investigated  the  relationship  between  these  variables  and  the production data in the corresponding industries from 1995 to 2017.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Method</h5>

                  <p>
                  Following  the  models  explained  in <strong>Timmer  et  al.  (2015)</strong>,  we  calculated  the  value  added contribution into each industry in Japan in 1995 from WIOT. This includes all the value added from every country involved in the production chain of the particular good in the industry.
                  In the model, when N represents the number of countries and S denotes the number of industries in each country, value added g(s, n) created by an industry s in a country n to the last-stage production in a specific industry is calculated as follows. </p>

                  <div class="item">
                    <image class="responsive_small" src="img/io_table/method_1.png"></image>
                  </div>
                  <br>

                  <p>
                  In the equation, <strong>g</strong> is a SN-vector which represents the value added created in each of the SNcountry-industry involved in a value chain. <strong>Fe</strong> represents the summation vector of the final output of the good among all countries.
                  Leontief inverse <strong>inv(I-A)</strong> is used so that the value-added contributions by all tiers of suppliers are taken into account. <strong>v-hat</strong> is a vector of value added over gross output ratio.
                  Using WIOT from 1995 and 2010, we calculated g from each country to the 15 manufacturing industries in Japan.
                  Then, we calculated the foreign value added share of the total value added to the industry, named <strong>GVC-dependence</strong>. This is our measure of the industry’s dependency on GVC and we assumed this value to be somewhat time invariant.</p>

                  <p>Meanwhile, I broke down the foreign value added by countrie to measure the Japanese industry’s dependency on each country to match with the disaster data per country.
                    Disaster  data  is  taken  from  the  <strong>EM_DAT  database</strong>  made  by <strong>Center  for  Research  on  the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED)</strong> in Belgium.
                    The dataset contains essential data on the occurrence and effects of mass disasters in the world. Extracting six major natural disaster categories (earthquake, flood, hurricane, etc.) from the dataset, we calculated the risk for the 40 countries in the WIOT.
                    Then, we multiplied the country-dependence share with the country’s disaster risk to calculate GVC-riskmeasures for Japanese industries. Both country-dependence share and the disaster risk range from 0 to 1 so does DRM, as it is a multiple of the networks.
                  </p>

                  </div>
                  <br>

                  <p>In order to measure the impact of GVC risk to Japanese economy at industry level, we used the <strong>Indices of Industrial Production (IIP)</strong> reported by Ministry of Education, Trade, and Industry in Japan as dependent variables.
                    The Japanese dataset includes monthly indices on production, shipments, and inventory on 102 manufactured goods categories.
                    We matched the industry categories between the this dataset and WIOT to measure the impact of GVC risk by industry.</p>

                  <h5>Results</h5>

                  </div>
                  <br>

                  <div class="item">
                    <image class="responsive" src="img/io_table/result_2.png"></image>
                    <h6 style="text-align: center;">Figure 2</h6>
                  </div>
                  <br>

                  <p>By  calculating  the  foreign  value  added contribution from WIOT in 1995 and 2010, we  captured  the  recent  trend  toward  more international value chain networks in the 14 Japanese manufacturing industries. (Figure 1) This result goes along with the main findings from Los et al. (2015).
                    However, when we calculated the GVC-Riskwith  the  disaster  data,  the  number  almost proportionally decreased across the industries, which made it difficult to compare the risk between the industries. This was due to the lack of variability in the risk variable between the industries.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Another challenge was the very low values of these variables. Figure 2 shows that the GVC-Risk variables were below 0.04 for all industries. Furthermore,  the  production  indices  from METI  varied  significantly  across  the industries.
                    When we tried to control for this variance  with  pre-trend  or  time  and  other fixed  effects,  the  model  lost  simplicity  and strength in the process.
                    Although  we  observed  some  statistically significant   coefficients,   these   factors challenged  the  validity  of  our  regression results and our primary models did not show the  correlation  between  the GVC-Risk and industrial production indices.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Conclusion</h5>

                  <p>In this research, we investigated the spillover effects of natural disasters and the role of GVCs by looking at the industry-specific data from World Input-Output Table. Our main contribution was the creation of GVC-Risk variable for a specific industry in Japan by combining WIOT and EM_DAT database.
                    We also successfully showed the recent trend toward more international value  chain  for  the  manufacturing  industries  in  the  country  calculated  from  value  added contribution, which goes along with the main finding of the WIOD project
                  </p>

                  <p>In spite of these achievements, due to the time limitation and the complex nature of natural disasters, our regression models need to be improved. Some of our major challenges were measuring  the  size  of  natural  disasters  and  dealing  with  dates,  especially  since  we  are discussing the lagged effects of natural disasters on foreign industries.
                     Besides these downsides, however, the combination of WIOT and EM_DAT is a very powerful tool to measure the effects of a supply-shock through the complex international economy.
