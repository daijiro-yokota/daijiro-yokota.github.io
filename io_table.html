                <h2>World Input-Output Table</h2>

                <p>Increasing global integration through international trade and technological development is linked to an increasing inequality between countries as well as between various classes within society.
                  Any analysis of their causes and effects needs to recognize the dynamic interrelatedness of countries and industries.
                  The World Input Output Database (WIOD) project (which ran from May 1, 2009 to May 1, 2012) has developed new databases, accounting frameworks and models to increase our understanding of the above-mentioned phenomena.
                  The core of the database is a set of harmonized supply and use tables, alongside with data on international trade in goods and services.
                  Researchers in the European Commission created the international Input-Output table that captures the exchange of value-added among the EU countries and some major economies in the world.


                <p>which provides time-series data of the intermediate input values delivered across sectors worldwide at current prices, denoted in millions of U.S. dollars.
                   The database covers 27 EU countries and 14 major countries in the world for the period from 1995 to 2010.
                    For each country, the database details intermediate input and final output for 35 industries including agriculture, construction, 14 manufacturing industries,  business services and more.
                    The database was constructed by systematically merging various national accounts data including ISWGNA (Intersecretariat Working Group on National Accounts) and international trade statistics.
                    The driving value of the WIOT is that it is specifically constructed to track development patterns over time using a time-series table of value-added, trade, and import/export metrics.
                    Through these metrics, it better captures the trade participation of each country by tracking the value-added at each stage of production
                    including intermediaries as well as the value-added by suppliers more upstream in the production process.
                    This advantage lets us measure the formation of GVCs with the method created by Timmer â€˜et al (2015).
                     For calculating the key variables, we followed their linear algebra calculation to transform intermediate input values to value-added for every sector.</p>

                <p>For S = 35 industries in N = 41 countries in the WIOT, we followed their linear algebra calculation to transform intermediate input values to value-added, which is explained by,
                   where g is an SN-vector which represents the value-added delivered to industry k in a country i in year t, created by each of the SN country-industries.
                    The choice for a final output matrix Fe determines which (i,k) is considered and it represents the summation vector of the final output of the good among all countries.
                    v is a vector of value-added over gross output ratio and A gives the intermediate inputs required per unit of gross output.
                     Leontief inverse (I-A)-1 is used so that the value-added contributions by all tiers of suppliers are taken into account.
                     In order to transform every value of intermediate inputs transactions between the 1435 sectors into value-added,
                     we plugged in 41 different matrices to Fe to calculate an SN-vector g for 1435 sectors in the equation.
                </p>

                <p>Using this table, I have done the following two research projects at Macalester.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Macroeconomic Impacts of Joining the European Union for the New Member States</li>
                  <li>Measuring Valunerability of Japanese Manufacturing Industries to Foreign Natural Disaster Risk</li>
                </ol>

                <p>I am going to upload the summary and findings from these researches soon. Please feel free to shoot me an email if you would like to know more about the projects or the dataset.</p>
