These are some features/posts I would like to add to my website in the future.

3. Bayesian? Maybe...



<Features, by priority>
1. I want the sidebar to move as I scroll down so that I can see what's on it always.

2. I want to make categories so that people can see what they are interested in easily. ex. Business, Statistics, Economics, Technology, etc.

3. Blog?

4. Contact Form. This requires some research because Github Page only supports STATIC website.

<Technical>

1. I want the sidebar to be made on a separate file so that I don't have to make changes across every page when I have to change something on it.
