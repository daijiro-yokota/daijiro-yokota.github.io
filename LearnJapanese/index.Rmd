# Preface {-}

This book contains notes for anyone learing Japanese online. This is a living document, which will get updated regularly. When you find typos or have clarifying questions, please email daijiroyokota81@gmail.com.


## Acknowledgments {-}

These notes would not be possible without the **bookdown package** and the many open-source R packages used throughout the text. We thank the developers of these packages for making this work possible. The structure of this book is strongly influenced by the [`bookdown` text](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown) written by Yihui Xie.
